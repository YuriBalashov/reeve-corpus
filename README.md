# The Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation Trilingual Corpus
This repository contains data associated with the project described in the paper [Translation Analytics for Freelancers: I. Introduction, Data Preparation, Baseline Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00613) by Yuri Balashov, Alex Balashov, and Shiho Fukuda Koski. The study introduces a practical framework for individual translators and smaller language service providers (LSPs) to evaluate translation quality using both human and automatic methods.

This paper is part of a larger project intending to empower freelance translators with Translation Analytics tools—techniques traditionally reserved for large-scale industry workflows—by adapting them to the needs of freelancers using freely available software and bilingual corpora.

## Repository Structure

The corpus and associated files are organized as follows:

### `/reeve-corpus/en-ru-ja-pdf`
This directory contains PDF versions of the Reeve Foundation's *Paralysis Resource Guide (PRG)* and its Russian and Japanese translations which are used in the experiments:

- `PRG-IntEd_en.pdf` — English source version  
- `PRG-IntEd_ru.pdf` — Russian professional human translation  
- `PRG-IntEd_ja.pdf` — Japanese professional human translation  

### `/reeve-corpus/en-ru-ja-reference`
This directory includes the primary corpus files in Excel format. These contain aligned trilingual segments in English, Russian, and Japanese:

- `1-10_en-ru-ja_long.xlsx` — Full version: 4528 segments with IDs  
- `1-10_en-ru-ja_short.xlsx` — Reduced version (3896 segments, no short sentences)  
- `1-8_en-ru-ja_short.xlsx` — Further trimmed (3555 segments) for tool compatibility  
- `2_en-ru-ja_short.xlsx` to `10_en-ru-ja_short.xlsx` — Section-specific segment sets

### `/reeve-corpus/en-ru-ja-outputs`
Translation outputs generated by three major neural machine translation (MT) engines and three large language models (LLMs):

- `1-10_en-ru-ja_short_MT-LLM-outputs.xlsx` — MT and LLM outputs aligned with reference data and segment IDs  

### `/reeve-corpus/en-ru-ja-comet-human-scores`
Human and automatic evaluation scores (COMET) for selected subsets of the corpus:

- `3_en-ru-ja_short_comet_grades.xlsx`  
- `5_en-ru-ja_short_comet_grades.xlsx`  

These include segment-level COMET scores and human ratings on a 0.0–4.0 scale.
