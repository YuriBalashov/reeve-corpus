# The Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation Trilingual Corpus
This repository contains the complete dataset used in the "Translation Analytics for Freelancers" project. The project demonstrates how freelance translators and smaller language service providers can leverage both automatic evaluation metrics (such as BLEU, chrF, TER, and COMET) and human judgment to assess and improve translation quality. Detailed methodology and experimental results are described in our [accompanying paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00613).
