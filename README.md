This repository contains data associated with the project described in the paper "Translation Analytics for Freelancers: I. Introduction, Data Preparation, Baseline Evaluations" by Yuri Balashov, Alex Balashov, and Shiho Fukuda Koski. The study introduces a practical framework for individual translators and smaller language service providers (LSPs) to evaluate translation quality using both human and automatic methodsthe complete dataset used in the "Translation Analytics for Freelancers" project. The project demonstrates how freelance translators and smaller language service providers can leverage both automatic evaluation metrics (such as BLEU, chrF, TER, and COMET) and human judgment to assess and improve translation quality. Detailed methodology and experimental results are described in our [accompanying paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00613).
