# The Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation Trilingual Corpus
This repository contains data associated with the project described in the paper [Translation Analytics for Freelancers: I. Introduction, Data Preparation, Baseline Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00613) by Yuri Balashov, Alex Balashov, and Shiho Fukuda Koski. The study introduces a practical framework for individual translators and smaller language service providers (LSPs) to evaluate translation quality using both human and automatic methods.

This paper is part of a larger project intending to empower freelance translators with Translation Analytics tools—techniques traditionally reserved for large-scale industry workflows—by adapting them to the needs of freelancers using freely available software and bilingual corpora.
